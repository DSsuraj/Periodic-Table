's' block elements, (except helium) are those in which the valence-shell is the 'ns' orbital and where the last electron enters into the 's' orbital
 of the outer element. The general outer electronic configuration of such elements is either ns1or ns2. The 's' block elements belong to group 1 and 
2 of the long form periodic table. They are situated on the left side of the table.

*The main characteristics of the 's' block elements are:

1.The general outer electronic configurations of 's' block elements are ns1-2 as all inner shells are already full.
2.The 's' block elements are either all alkali metals like Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs and Fr, as in group 1 (having ns1 outer electronic configuration) or 
  alkaline Earth metals like Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Ra, as in group 2 (having ns2 outer electronic configurations).
3.The 's' block metals are soft and have a low melting and boiling point.
4.The metals are very active. They are highly electropositive and lose their valence electrons to form monovalent or divalent cation.
5.Being highly electropositive, these elements lose electrons readily and are strong reducing agents.
6.The 's' block elements mostly form ionic compounds like NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 etc.
